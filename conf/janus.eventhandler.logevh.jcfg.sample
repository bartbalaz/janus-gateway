# This configures the sample event handler. Since this plugin simply
# forwards each event it receives via HTTP POST, you simply need to
# configure (i) which events to subscribe to, and (ii) the address of
# the web server which will receive the requests.

general: {
	enabled = false		# By default the module is not enabled
	events = "all"		# Comma separated list of the events mask you're interested
